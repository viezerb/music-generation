# music-generation

This application generates midi songs using input parameters by the user.

To run the application run train.py
You will need python3.8 or 3.9 to run the script.
Other requirements may vary depending on the OS you run this on, and the python version (especially TensorFlow/Keras and TKinter)

To run the training process uncomment the make_index() and train() functions and comment the rest in the main function
To run the generating process uncomment the generate_all() function and comment the rest

Alternatively you can set other parameters like track_length, sequence_length and file naming conventions from the top of the script.
